          __description__<br />Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean
          Abelialeaf) is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the olive
          family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species, Abeliophyllum distichum
          Nakai, endemic to Korea, where it is endangered in the wild, occurring
          at only seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having
          white, not yellow, flowers. It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2
          m tall. The leaves are opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5
          cm wide, pubescent both above and below. The flowers are produced in
          early spring before the new leaves appear; they are white and
          fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a
          round, winged samara 2 to 3 cm diameter. It is cultivated as an
          ornamental plant in Europe and North America.
